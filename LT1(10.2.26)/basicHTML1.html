        Once upon a time there were dinosaurs.
        They were big and scary.
        But they are extinct now. </p> 

    <p>
        <strong>These dinosaurs are now extinct.</strong>
        <br><mark>We can only see them in museums.</mark>
        <em>They are now only found in fossil records. What a pity</em><br>
        <small>But sometimes I daydream if they existed now, what could have happened to the modern world?</small><br>
        Well I think we can adapt to the new environment and live together with them harmoniously...or not <br>
    </p>
